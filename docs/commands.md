# Command Palette

Complete list of commands available in the command palette, opened with `:`.
In transfer mode, the command palette only shows commands that are available for the active transfer pane.
The tab strip is only shown when two or more browser tabs are open.

| Command | Shown when | Behavior / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `New tab` | Always | Opens a new browser tab initialized from the current directory. |
| `Next tab` | Two or more tabs are open | Activates the next browser tab. |
| `Previous tab` | Two or more tabs are open | Activates the previous browser tab. |
| `Close current tab` | Two or more tabs are open | Closes the active browser tab. The last remaining tab cannot be closed. |
| `Find files` | Always | Opens recursive file search. |
| `Grep search` | Always | Opens recursive grep search (`ripgrep` / `rg` required on `PATH`) with keyword, filename, include-extension, and exclude-extension filters. |
| `Grep in selected files` | A file is focused or one or more files are selected in the current directory | Opens grep search limited to the selected files, or the focused file when nothing is explicitly selected. Type a keyword to search within those files via grep, and matching lines appear in the palette. |
| `History search` | Always | Opens directory history list and jump to a selected directory. |
| `Show bookmarks` | Always | Opens the saved bookmark list and jumps to the selected directory. |
| `Go back` | Directory history has a previous entry | Moves to the previous directory in history. |
| `Go forward` | Directory history has a forward entry | Moves to the next directory in history. |
| `Go to path` | Always | Opens go-to-path input to navigate to a specific path, shows matching directories, and supports `Tab` completion for the selected candidate. On native Windows, drive roots are also offered so you can switch between drives quickly. |
| `Go to home directory` | Always | Navigates to the home directory. |
| `Reload directory` | Always | Reloads the current directory. |
| `Toggle transfer mode` / `Close transfer mode` | Always | Switches between the normal three-pane browser and the two-pane transfer layout. |
| `Undo last file operation` | Undo history is not empty | Reverses the most recent undoable rename, paste, or trash operation. |
| `Select all` | Current directory has at least one visible entry | Selects every currently visible entry in the current directory, respecting hidden-file visibility and any active filter. |
| `Replace text in selected files` | A file is focused or one or more files are selected in the current directory | Opens a two-field replacement palette for the selected files, or the focused file when nothing is explicitly selected. Matching files appear in the palette, and the right pane shows the selected file's diff before the replacement is applied. |
| `Replace text in found files` | Always | Opens a three-field replacement palette (filename, find, replace). Type a filename pattern to search for files, then type find/replace text to preview replacements. The right pane shows the diff preview, and the replacement is applied on confirmation. |
| `Replace text in grep results` | Always | Opens a five-field replacement palette (keyword, replace, filename filter, include extensions, exclude extensions). The keyword is both the grep search term and the text to replace. Type a keyword to grep search, then type a replacement to preview changes. Optional filename and extension filters narrow which matched files are affected. The right pane shows the diff preview, and the replacement is applied on confirmation. |
| `Grep and replace in selected files` | A file is focused or one or more files are selected in the current directory | Opens a two-field replacement palette (keyword, replace) for the selected files, or the focused file when nothing is explicitly selected. The keyword searches within those files via grep, matching lines appear in the palette, and the right pane shows the selected file's diff before the replacement is applied. |
| `Show attributes` | Exactly one target is selected or focused | Opens the read-only attribute dialog for the selected item. |
| `Rename` | Exactly one target is selected or focused | Starts rename input for a single target. |
| `Change permissions` | Exactly one target is selected or focused in a real filesystem workspace on Linux, macOS, or WSL | Starts permission input for a single target. Enter a three-digit octal mode such as `755` or `644`. This command is hidden in search workspaces and native Windows because Windows does not expose POSIX permission bits through `chmod`. |
| `Change permissions recursively` | One or more targets are selected or focused in a real filesystem workspace on Linux, macOS, or WSL | Starts permission input for recursive chmod. The mode is applied to all selected targets, or the focused target when nothing is selected, including directory descendants. Symlinks are skipped and never followed. This command is hidden in search workspaces and native Windows. |
| `Compress as zip` | At least one target is selected or focused | Starts zip compression for the selected items, or the focused item when nothing is selected. The destination input accepts absolute and relative paths resolved from the current directory, defaults to a `.zip` path next to the selected content, and asks for confirmation before overwriting an existing zip file. |
| `Extract archive` | Exactly one supported archive file is selected or focused | Starts archive extraction for `.zip`, `.tar`, `.tar.gz`, or `.tar.bz2`. The destination input accepts absolute and relative paths. Relative paths are resolved from the archive file's parent directory, and the default value is a same-name directory next to the archive. Existing destination paths are confirmed before extraction, and the status bar shows entry-count progress while the extraction runs. |
| `Open in editor` | Exactly one file is selected or focused | Opens the focused file in a terminal editor, using `editor.command` -> `$EDITOR` -> built-in defaults. |
| `Open in GUI editor` | Exactly one file is selected or focused | Opens the focused file in a configured GUI editor. |
| `Copy path` | At least one target is selected or focused | Copies the selected path list, or the focused path when nothing is selected, to the system clipboard. |
| `Move to trash` | At least one target is selected or focused | Moves the selected items, or the focused item, to trash (confirmation is enabled by default and can be configured). On Windows this uses the Recycle Bin via `send2trash`. |
| `Empty trash` | Always | Permanently deletes all items from the trash. Shows a confirmation dialog before emptying. On Windows this uses PowerShell's `Clear-RecycleBin` to empty the Recycle Bin. |
| `Open in file manager` | Always | Opens the current directory in the OS file manager. |
| `Open current directory in GUI editor` | Always | Opens zivo's current directory in the configured GUI editor. |
| `Open terminal` | Always | Launches an external terminal rooted at zivo's current directory, using `config.toml` templates before built-in fallbacks. |
| `Run shell command` | Always | Opens a one-line shell command dialog, runs the command in the current directory in the background, and returns the first output line or failure summary in the status bar. On Windows, zivo prefers `powershell.exe`, then `pwsh`, then `cmd.exe`, so command syntax follows the selected Windows shell rather than POSIX `sh`. |
| Custom actions | Matches each configured action's `when` and `extensions` settings | Shows entries from `[[actions.custom]]` in `config.toml`. zivo confirms the expanded command before running it. See [Custom Actions](custom-actions.md). |
| `Bookmark this directory` / `Remove bookmark` | Always | Saves or removes the current directory in `[bookmarks].paths`. The label reflects whether the current directory is already bookmarked. |
| `Show hidden files` / `Hide hidden files` | Always | Toggles hidden-file visibility for the browser panes. The label reflects the current visibility state. |
| `Edit config` | Always | Opens the settings overlay for startup defaults. You can edit the preferred terminal editor, GUI editor preset, external terminal launch mode, hidden-file visibility, directory-size visibility, text preview visibility, image preview visibility, image preview mode, PDF preview visibility, Office preview visibility, preview size limit, theme, sorting, default paste-conflict behavior, and delete confirmation. The overlay also explains what the selected setting changes so you do not need to cross-reference the README while browsing options. Theme changes are previewed immediately. |
| `Create file` | Always | Starts the inline create-file flow in the current directory. |
| `Create directory` | Always | Starts the inline create-directory flow in the current directory. |
