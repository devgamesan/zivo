# Keybindings

Complete list of keybindings for all zivo modes.

## Normal Mode

You can open an external terminal directly from zivo. Press `t` to suspend zivo and open an interactive shell in the current terminal at zivo's current directory. When you exit the shell, zivo resumes automatically. Alternatively, press `T` to launch a separate terminal window.
