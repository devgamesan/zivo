Peneo is a TUI file manager you can use without memorizing keybindings. Common actions stay visible in the help bar at the bottom, and less-frequent actions are available from the command palette.

- **No memorization needed**: Common actions are always visible in the help bar
- **Never get lost**: All actions can be called from the command palette
- **Clear 3-pane layout**: Parent, current, and child directories displayed side by side
- **Embedded terminal**: Seamlessly switch between browsing and shell with `t`
- **Powerful search**: Jump directly to files with recursive file search and grep search

## Features

- Simple three-pane layout for parent / current / child directories. You can navigate directories, multi-select items, copy, cut, paste, move items to trash, permanently delete items with `Shift+Delete`, copy paths, rename, create files or directories, extract archives, create zip archives, search for files, run grep searches, and execute one-line shell commands entirely from the keyboard. Common actions stay visible in the help bar at the bottom.

- Less frequent actions are grouped in the command palette, so you can discover and run them without memorizing every shortcut.

  ![](docs/resources/screen-command-palette.png)

- An embedded terminal can be opened below the browser panes. `t` switches quickly between the browser and terminal, and the terminal starts in the current directory so you can move between browsing and shell work without changing directories manually.

- Recursive file search makes it easy to jump to the file you want without drilling through the directory tree manually.

- Recursive grep search is available under the current directory. You can jump from search results directly to the matching file.

  ![](docs/resources/screen-grep-command.png)

- Filter input and sort switching are supported. The example below filters by `.py` and sorts by modified time in descending order.

- Bookmarks let you jump directly to saved directories.

  ![](docs/resources/screen-bookmark.png)

- History lets you jump back to recently visited directories.

  ![](docs/resources/screen-history.png)

- Press `e` on a file to switch into a terminal editor in the current terminal session. Editors such as `nvim`, `vim`, and `nano` can be used seamlessly.

  ![](docs/resources/screen-terminal-editor.png)

- Files and directories can be opened with the OS default application. For example, you can open the current directory in the OS file manager, open a file in VS Code if it is associated on the OS side, or launch an external terminal window rooted at the current directory.

## Supported OS

| OS | Support Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ubuntu | Supported | Primary verified environment at the moment. |
| Ubuntu (WSL) | Supported | WSL running Ubuntu is part of the verified environments. |

| Windows | Not supported at this time | Native Windows runtime is not supported. |

## Installation

### Install from PyPI

With `uv` installed, install Peneo directly from PyPI.

```bash
uv tool install peneo
```

### Install from repository

Alternatively, clone the repository and install Peneo as a tool.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devgamesan/peneo.git
cd peneo
uv tool install --from . peneo
```

### Dependencies

Peneo itself can be installed and started with `uv`, but some features depend on external commands being available on `PATH`. The required tools vary by OS or environment.

#### Ubuntu / Debian

- For grep search (`g`): `ripgrep` (`rg`)
- For copy path:
  - X11: `xclip`
  - Wayland: `wl-copy`

Install example:

```bash
sudo apt install ripgrep xclip
```

Wayland example:

```bash
sudo apt install ripgrep wl-clipboard
```

#### Ubuntu (WSL)

- For grep search (`g`): `ripgrep` (`rg`)
- For copy path:
  - `clip.exe` is usually available
  - Linux-side `xclip` / `wl-copy` can also be used when needed
- `wslu` is recommended for GUI bridge commands such as `wslview`

Install example:

```bash
sudo apt install ripgrep wslu
```

#### macOS

- For grep search (`g`): `ripgrep` (`rg`)
- For copy path: the built-in `pbcopy`

Install example:

```bash
brew install ripgrep
```

#### Windows

- Not supported at this time
- Dependency guidance for native Windows runtime is out of scope

To update, pull the latest changes and run the same install command again.

## Run

```bash
peneo
```

`peneo` itself cannot change the current directory of the parent shell. If you want your shell to `cd` into the last directory you visited after quitting Peneo, add the following line to your shell startup file first, such as `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```bash
eval "$(peneo init bash)"  # for bash
eval "$(peneo init zsh)"   # for zsh
```

Open a new shell, or run the same line once in your current shell to enable it immediately. This defines a shell function named `peneo-cd`. After that, launch `peneo-cd` instead of `peneo` when you want the shell directory to follow Peneo on exit:

```bash
peneo-cd
```

Use plain `peneo` when you do not need that behavior.

When a file is focused, press `e` to switch into a terminal editor in the current terminal session. Peneo prefers `config.toml` `editor.command` when set, then falls back to `$EDITOR`, then built-in defaults such as `nvim`, `vim`, or `nano`.

## Configuration File

On startup, Peneo reads `config.toml` from the platform-specific user config directory.
If the file does not exist yet, Peneo creates it automatically with default values.

- Linux: `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/peneo/config.toml`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/peneo/config.toml`
- Windows config path is reserved for future compatibility, but native Windows runtime is still unsupported

The supported settings are:

| Section | Key | Values | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `terminal` | `linux` | Array of shell-style command templates | Optional terminal launch commands for Linux. Use `{path}` as the working-directory placeholder. Invalid or empty entries are ignored. |
| `terminal` | `macos` | Array of shell-style command templates | Optional terminal launch commands for macOS, validated the same way as Linux entries. |
| `terminal` | `windows` | Array of shell-style command templates | Optional terminal launch commands for Windows and WSL bridge workflows. The config key is accepted even though native Windows runtime is not currently supported. |
| `editor` | `command` | Shell-style string, for example `nvim -u NONE` | Optional terminal editor command used by `e`. Do not include the file path; Peneo appends it automatically. Unsupported GUI editors or invalid commands are ignored. |
| `display` | `show_hidden_files` | `true` / `false` | Default hidden-file visibility when the app starts. |
| `display` | `show_directory_sizes` | `true` / `false` | Shows recursive directory sizes in the panes. Defaults to `false` because large directories can be expensive to scan. Peneo also calculates sizes automatically while the main pane is sorted by `size`. |
| `display` | `theme` | `textual-dark` / `textual-light` | Default UI theme applied on startup and after saving from the settings editor. |
| `display` | `default_sort_field` | `name` / `modified` / `size` | Default sort field for the main pane. |
| `display` | `default_sort_descending` | `true` / `false` | Starts the main-pane sort in descending order when enabled. |
| `display` | `directories_first` | `true` / `false` | Keeps directories grouped before files in the main pane. |
| `behavior` | `confirm_delete` | `true` / `false` | Shows a confirmation dialog before moving items to trash. Permanent delete via `Shift+Delete` always asks for confirmation. |
| `behavior` | `paste_conflict_action` | `prompt` / `overwrite` / `skip` / `rename` | Chooses the default paste-conflict behavior. `prompt` keeps the conflict dialog enabled. |
| `logging` | `enabled` | `true` / `false` | Enables file output for startup failures and unhandled exceptions. |
| `logging` | `level` | `DEBUG` / `INFO` / `WARNING` / `ERROR` / `CRITICAL` | Log level for file output. Defaults to `ERROR`. Requires app restart to take effect. |
| `logging` | `path` | Path string | Optional log file path. Leave empty to use `peneo.log` next to `config.toml`. Default log file locations: Linux: `~/.config/peneo/peneo.log`, macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/peneo/peneo.log`. |
| `bookmarks` | `paths` | Array of absolute path strings | Bookmarked directories shown by `Ctrl+B` and `Show bookmarks` in the command palette. Duplicate paths are removed when the config is loaded. |

Example:

```toml
[terminal]
linux = ["konsole --working-directory {path}", "gnome-terminal --working-directory={path}"]
macos = ["open -a Terminal {path}"]
windows = ["wt -d {path}"]

[editor]
command = "nvim -u NONE"

[display]
show_hidden_files = false
show_directory_sizes = false
theme = "textual-dark"
default_sort_field = "name"
default_sort_descending = false
directories_first = true

[behavior]
confirm_delete = true
paste_conflict_action = "prompt"

[logging]
enabled = true
level = "ERROR"
path = ""

[bookmarks]
paths = ["/home/user/src", "/home/user/docs"]
```

Invalid config values do not stop startup. Peneo falls back to built-in defaults and shows a warning after the initial directory load.
When logging is enabled, startup failures and unhandled exceptions are appended to the configured log file for later investigation.

`e` switches into a terminal editor in the current terminal session rather than opening a separate GUI app window. If both `editor.command` and `$EDITOR` are set, `editor.command` takes precedence.

## Command Palette

Less frequent actions are grouped in the command palette opened with `:`.

| Command | Shown when | Behavior / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Find files` | Always | Opens recursive file search. |
| `Grep search` | Always | Opens recursive grep search (`ripgrep` / `rg` required on `PATH`). |
| `History search` | Always | Opens directory history list and jump to a selected directory. |
| `Show bookmarks` | Always | Opens the saved bookmark list and jumps to the selected directory. |
| `Go back` | Directory history has a previous entry | Moves to the previous directory in history. |
| `Go forward` | Directory history has a forward entry | Moves to the next directory in history. |
| `Go to path` | Always | Opens go-to-path input to navigate to a specific path, shows matching directories, and supports `Tab` completion for the selected candidate. |
| `Go to home directory` | Always | Navigates to the home directory. |
| `Reload directory` | Always | Reloads the current directory. |
| `Toggle split terminal` | Always | Opens or closes the embedded split terminal. |
| `Select all` | Current directory has at least one visible entry | Selects every currently visible entry in the current directory, respecting hidden-file visibility and any active filter. |
| `Show attributes` | Exactly one target is selected or focused | Opens the read-only attribute dialog for the selected item. Also available with `i`. |
| `Rename` | Exactly one target is selected or focused | Starts rename input for a single target. |
| `Compress as zip` | At least one target is selected or focused | Starts zip compression for the selected items, or the focused item when nothing is selected. The destination input accepts absolute and relative paths resolved from the current directory, defaults to a `.zip` path next to the selected content, and asks for confirmation before overwriting an existing zip file. |
| `Extract archive` | Exactly one supported archive file is selected or focused | Starts archive extraction for `.zip`, `.tar`, `.tar.gz`, or `.tar.bz2`. The destination input accepts absolute and relative paths. Relative paths are resolved from the archive file's parent directory, and the default value is a same-name directory next to the archive. Existing destination paths are confirmed before extraction, and the status bar shows entry-count progress while the extraction runs. |
| `Open in editor` | Exactly one file is selected or focused | Opens the focused file in a terminal editor, using `editor.command` -> `$EDITOR` -> built-in defaults. |

| `Run shell command` | Always | Opens a one-line shell command dialog, runs the command in the current directory in the background, and returns the first output line or failure summary in the status bar. Also available with `!`. |
| `Bookmark this directory` / `Remove bookmark` | Always | Saves or removes the current directory in `[bookmarks].paths`. The label reflects whether the current directory is already bookmarked. Also available with `b`. |
| `Show hidden files` / `Hide hidden files` | Always | Toggles hidden-file visibility for the browser panes. The label reflects the current visibility state. Also available with `.`. |
| `Edit config` | Always | Opens the settings overlay for startup defaults. You can edit the preferred terminal editor, hidden-file visibility, directory-size visibility, theme, sorting, default paste-conflict behavior, and delete confirmation. Use `↑` / `↓` to move, `←` / `→` / `Enter` to change values, `s` to save `config.toml`, and `e` to open the raw config file in a terminal editor. |
| `Create file` | Always | Starts the inline create-file flow in the current directory. |
| `Create directory` | Always | Starts the inline create-directory flow in the current directory. |

## Notes

- Refer to the "Supported OS" section above for current support status.
- GUI integration such as default-app launch, file-manager launch, and external terminal launch is currently verified mainly on Ubuntu and Ubuntu running under WSL.
- The embedded split terminal currently targets POSIX environments, especially Ubuntu/Linux and WSL.
- `config.toml` can override both the preferred terminal editor and external terminal launch commands before built-in fallbacks are used.
- On WSL, `wslu` is recommended so `wslview` is available for the preferred bridge behavior.
- On WSL, Peneo prefers Windows-side bridges such as `wslview`, `explorer.exe`, and `clip.exe` when available, while keeping Linux-side fallbacks for WSLg and desktop Linux environments.
- Behavior and keybindings may change in future revisions.
- File mutations operate on the selected directory entry. If the selected item is a symlink, Peneo mutates the symlink itself instead of silently following and mutating the link target.
