# Plain

[日本語版 README](README.ja.md)

Plain is a Textual-based TUI file manager that aims to feel closer to a GUI explorer.
It is designed so you can reach the main actions without having to study a Vim-style key map first.

_Current three-pane UI showing the parent, current, and child directories side by side._

## Features

- Three-pane layout for parent / current / child directories
- Keyboard-only navigation, selection, copy, cut, paste, delete, rename, and create flows
- Filter input, sort switching, and hidden-file visibility toggle
- Less frequent actions grouped into a command palette so everyday keys stay small in number
- Files open with the OS default app, `e` opens the current file in the editor inside the current terminal, and a terminal can also be launched in the current directory

## Current Capabilities

- Browse directories and move through the filesystem
- Multi-select files and directories
- copy / cut / paste
- Move items to trash
- Rename a single target
- Create files and directories
- Filter by file name
- Switch sorting by name / modified time / size
- Toggle directories-first ordering
- Copy paths to the system clipboard
- Launch a terminal in the current directory
- Toggle hidden-file visibility
- Open files with the OS default app
- Open files in the editor inside the current terminal

## Installation

With `uv` installed, clone the repository and install Plain as a tool.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devgamesan/plain.git
cd plain
uv tool install --from . plain
```

To update, pull the latest changes and run the same install command again.

## Run

```bash
plain
```

To launch directly from a local checkout during development, run this from the repository root:

```bash
uv run plain
```

Commands still under development may appear dimmed and cannot be executed yet.

## Platform Notes

- The project is currently verified only on Ubuntu.
- The code contains external-launch implementations for Linux / macOS / Windows, but not every platform path is fully validated.
- The application is still under active development, so behavior and keybindings may change.
