[日本語版 README](README.ja.md)

zivo is a simple and intuitive TUI file manager that lets you browse, search, and operate files without memorizing commands — a Zero-friction Interface for Viewing & Operations.

zivo aims to be usable by everyone without complex configuration, plugin installation, or script creation. It does not aim to do everything — it focuses on making common operations comfortable and simple to perform.

- **No memorization needed**: Common actions are always visible in the help bar
- **Never get lost**: All actions can be called from the command palette
- **Clear 3-pane layout**: Parent, current, and right panes displayed side by side, with text, image, and document preview for focused files
- **Transfer mode**: Put two directories side by side to copy or move files with ease
- **Tabbed browsing**: Keep multiple browser workspaces open inside one TUI and switch between them quickly
- **Powerful search**: Jump directly to files with recursive file search and grep search
- **Terminal editor integration**: Launch your preferred terminal editor in the current directory
- **External app integration**: Open files directly with their default applications

## Features

- Simple three-pane layout for parent / current / right panes. When the cursor is on a directory, the right pane shows its children. When the cursor is on a common text file, the right pane shows a syntax-highlighted text preview. Common image formats can be previewed as character art through `chafa`, and `pdf`, `docx`, `xlsx`, and `pptx` files can also be previewed in the right pane. You can switch to a two-pane transfer layout for side-by-side directory copy and move workflows. You can navigate directories, multi-select items, copy, cut, paste, undo recent file operations, move items to trash, delete files, copy paths, rename, create files or directories, extract archives, create zip archives, replace text across selected files with a preview, replace text in files found by file search or grep search, search for files, run grep searches, and execute one-line shell commands entirely from the keyboard. Common actions stay visible in the help bar at the bottom.

- Less frequent actions are grouped in the command palette, so you can discover and run them without memorizing every shortcut.

  ![](docs/resources/screen-command-palette.png)

- The beginning of a text file can be previewed directly in the right pane, so you can quickly inspect the file without opening it. The preview size limit is configurable from `64 KiB` up to `1024 KiB`.

  ![](docs/resources/screen-text-preview.png)

- Multiple tabs let you keep separate working directories open in one zivo session. You can open a new tab, switch to the next or previous tab, and close the current tab without leaving the TUI.

- Recursive file search makes it easy to jump to the file you want. Just type part of the name to instantly filter through thousands of files and reach your target without drilling through the directory tree manually. Search results also support file preview, making it easy to find what you are looking for.

  ![](docs/resources/screen-find-command.png)

- Recursive grep search is available under the current directory. You can jump from search results directly to the matching file. Context lines around each match can be previewed, making it easy to find what you are looking for. The palette includes `Filter: Filename`, `Include extensions`, and `Exclude extensions` fields so you can narrow matches before opening them. You can also open the matching location directly in a terminal editor.

  ![](docs/resources/screen-grep-command.png)

- Filter input and sort switching are supported. The example below filters by `.py` and sorts by modified time in descending order.

  ![](docs/resources/screen-filter-sort.png)

- Bookmarks let you jump directly to saved directories.

  ![](docs/resources/screen-bookmark.png)

- History lets you jump back to recently visited directories.

  ![](docs/resources/screen-history.png)

- Press `e` on a file to switch into a terminal editor in the current terminal session. Editors such as `nvim`, `vim`, and `nano` can be used seamlessly. The following shows an example of opening Vim from zivo.

  ![](docs/resources/screen-terminal-editor.png)

- Multiple themes are available so you can choose your preferred look.

  ![](docs/resources/screen-theme1.png)
  ![](docs/resources/screen-theme2.png)

- Files and directories can be opened with the OS default application. For example, you can open the current directory in the OS file manager, open a file in VS Code if it is associated on the OS side, or launch an external terminal window rooted at the current directory.

## Supported OS

| OS | Support Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ubuntu | Supported | Primary verified environment at the moment. |
| Ubuntu (WSL) | Supported | WSL running Ubuntu is part of the verified environments. |
| macOS | Supported | Grant Full Disk Access to your terminal for trash operations. |
| Windows | Supported | Drive navigation, file operations, clipboard, shell commands, external terminal, undo, and most features. `zivo-cd` is not yet available on Windows. |

## Installation

### Prerequisites: Install uv

zivo uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) as the package manager. If you don't have it yet, install it first:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

For other installation methods, see the [uv official documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

### Install from PyPI

With `uv` installed, install zivo directly from PyPI.

```bash
uv tool install zivo
```

### Install from repository

Alternatively, clone the repository and install zivo as a tool.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devgamesan/zivo.git
cd zivo
uv tool install --from . zivo
```

To update, pull the latest changes and run the same install command again.

### Dependencies

zivo itself can be installed and started with `uv`, but some features depend on external commands being available on `PATH`. The required tools vary by OS or environment.

| Feature | Ubuntu / Debian | Ubuntu (WSL) | macOS | Windows |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Document preview (`docx` / `xlsx` / `pptx`) | `pandoc` 3.8.3+ | `pandoc` 3.8.3+ | `pandoc` 3.8.3+ | `pandoc` 3.8.3+ |
| Image preview (`png` / `jpg` / `gif` / `webp` / etc.) | `chafa` | `chafa` | `chafa` | `chafa` |
| PDF preview (`pdf`) | `poppler-utils` | `poppler-utils` | `poppler` | `poppler` (pdftotext) |
| Grep search (`g`) | `ripgrep` | `ripgrep` | `ripgrep` | `ripgrep` |
| Copy path (`C`) | X11: `xclip` / Wayland: `wl-clipboard` | Usually none (`clip.exe`), optional: `xclip` / `wl-clipboard` | None (`pbcopy` built in) | Built-in |
| GUI bridge commands | None | `wslu` recommended | None | Built-in |

**Note**: Some distributions may not provide pandoc 3.8.3+ through their package managers. If the installed version is older than 3.8.3, install the latest version manually from the official pandoc website: https://pandoc.org/installing.html

Install example:

```bash
# Ubuntu / Debian (X11)
sudo apt install chafa pandoc poppler-utils ripgrep xclip

# Ubuntu / Debian (Wayland)
sudo apt install chafa pandoc poppler-utils ripgrep wl-clipboard

# Ubuntu (WSL)
sudo apt install chafa pandoc poppler-utils ripgrep wslu

# macOS
brew install chafa pandoc poppler ripgrep
```

### Windows

On Windows, drive roots such as `C:\` support pressing `←` to return to the drive list so you can switch between drives without leaving zivo.

Install the required dependencies from their official websites:

- Document preview: [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)
- Image preview: [chafa](https://hpjansson.org/chafa/)
- PDF preview (`pdftotext`): [poppler for Windows](https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows)
- Grep search: [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)

On macOS, grant **Full Disk Access** to your terminal application. Open **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Full Disk Access** and enable the terminal app you use to run zivo (for example Terminal.app, iTerm2, or Alacritty). Without this permission, operations that access `~/.Trash` or other protected directories will fail.

## Run

```bash
zivo
```

`zivo` itself cannot change the current directory of the parent shell. If you want your shell to follow the last directory you visited after quitting zivo, add shell integration first:

```bash
eval "$(zivo init bash)"  # for bash
eval "$(zivo init zsh)"   # for zsh
```

**Note**: Shell integration (`zivo-cd`) is currently not supported on Windows. Use plain `zivo` on Windows.

This defines a shell function named `zivo-cd`. Start zivo with `zivo-cd` when you want the parent shell to `cd` into the last directory on exit:

```bash
zivo-cd
```

Use plain `zivo` when you only want to browse without changing the shell's working directory.

When a file is focused, press `e` to switch into a terminal editor in the current terminal session. zivo prefers `config.toml` `editor.command` when set, then falls back to `$EDITOR`, then built-in defaults such as `nvim`, `vim`, or `nano`.

## Keybindings

### Normal Mode

You can open an external terminal directly from zivo. Press `t` to suspend zivo and open an interactive shell in the current terminal at zivo's current directory. When you exit the shell, zivo resumes automatically—no need to manually change directories or manage multiple terminal windows. Alternatively, press `T` to launch a separate terminal window.

## Command Palette

Less frequent actions are grouped in the command palette opened with `:`.
In transfer mode, the command palette only shows commands that are available for the active transfer pane.
The tab strip is only shown when two or more browser tabs are open.

| Command | Shown when | Behavior / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `New tab` | Always | Opens a new browser tab initialized from the current directory. Also available with `o`. |
| `Next tab` | Two or more tabs are open | Activates the next browser tab. Also available with `tab`. |
| `Previous tab` | Two or more tabs are open | Activates the previous browser tab. Also available with `shift+tab`. |
| `Close current tab` | Two or more tabs are open | Closes the active browser tab. The last remaining tab cannot be closed. Also available with `w`. |
| `Find files` | Always | Opens recursive file search. |
| `Grep search` | Always | Opens recursive grep search (`ripgrep` / `rg` required on `PATH`) with keyword, filename, include-extension, and exclude-extension filters. |
| `Grep in selected files` | A file is focused or one or more files are selected in the current directory | Opens grep search limited to the selected files, or the focused file when nothing is explicitly selected. Type a keyword to search within those files via grep, and matching lines appear in the palette. Use `↑` / `↓` or `Ctrl+n` / `Ctrl+p` to move between results, `Enter` to navigate to the file, and `Ctrl+e` to open the file in a terminal editor. |
| `History search` | Always | Opens directory history list and jump to a selected directory. |
| `Show bookmarks` | Always | Opens the saved bookmark list and jumps to the selected directory. |
| `Go back` | Directory history has a previous entry | Moves to the previous directory in history. |
| `Go forward` | Directory history has a forward entry | Moves to the next directory in history. |
| `Go to path` | Always | Opens go-to-path input to navigate to a specific path, shows matching directories, and supports `Tab` completion for the selected candidate. On native Windows, drive roots are also offered so you can switch between drives quickly. |
| `Go to home directory` | Always | Navigates to the home directory. |
| `Reload directory` | Always | Reloads the current directory. |
| `Toggle transfer mode` / `Close transfer mode` | Always | Switches between the normal three-pane browser and the two-pane transfer layout. Also available with `p` from normal mode, and `p` / `Esc` while transfer mode is open. |
| `Undo last file operation` | Undo history is not empty | Reverses the most recent undoable rename, paste, or trash operation. Also available with `z`. |
| `Select all` | Current directory has at least one visible entry | Selects every currently visible entry in the current directory, respecting hidden-file visibility and any active filter. |
| `Replace text in selected files` | A file is focused or one or more files are selected in the current directory | Opens a two-field replacement palette for the selected files, or the focused file when nothing is explicitly selected. Matching files appear in the palette, `↑↓` and `Ctrl+n` / `Ctrl+p` move between them, and the right pane shows the selected file's diff before `Enter` applies the replacement. `Shift+↑` / `Shift+↓` scrolls the diff preview. |
| `Replace text in found files` | Always | Opens a three-field replacement palette (filename, find, replace). Type a filename pattern to search for files, then type find/replace text to preview replacements. `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` cycle between fields. The right pane shows the diff preview, and `Enter` applies the replacement. |
| `Replace text in grep results` | Always | Opens a five-field replacement palette (keyword, replace, filename filter, include extensions, exclude extensions). The keyword is both the grep search term and the text to replace. Type a keyword to grep search, then type a replacement to preview changes. Optional filename and extension filters narrow which matched files are affected. `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` cycle between fields. The right pane shows the diff preview, and `Enter` applies the replacement. |
| `Grep and replace in selected files` | A file is focused or one or more files are selected in the current directory | Opens a two-field replacement palette (keyword, replace) for the selected files, or the focused file when nothing is explicitly selected. The keyword searches within those files via grep, matching lines appear in the palette, and the right pane shows the selected file's diff before `Enter` applies the replacement. `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` cycle between fields. |
| `Show attributes` | Exactly one target is selected or focused | Opens the read-only attribute dialog for the selected item. Also available with `i`. |
| `Rename` | Exactly one target is selected or focused | Starts rename input for a single target. |
| `Compress as zip` | At least one target is selected or focused | Starts zip compression for the selected items, or the focused item when nothing is selected. The destination input accepts absolute and relative paths resolved from the current directory, defaults to a `.zip` path next to the selected content, and asks for confirmation before overwriting an existing zip file. |
| `Extract archive` | Exactly one supported archive file is selected or focused | Starts archive extraction for `.zip`, `.tar`, `.tar.gz`, or `.tar.bz2`. The destination input accepts absolute and relative paths. Relative paths are resolved from the archive file's parent directory, and the default value is a same-name directory next to the archive. Existing destination paths are confirmed before extraction, and the status bar shows entry-count progress while the extraction runs. |
| `Open in editor` | Exactly one file is selected or focused | Opens the focused file in a terminal editor, using `editor.command` -> `$EDITOR` -> built-in defaults. |
| `Copy path` | At least one target is selected or focused | Copies the selected path list, or the focused path when nothing is selected, to the system clipboard. Also available with `C`. |
| `Move to trash` | At least one target is selected or focused | Moves the selected items, or the focused item, to trash (confirmation is enabled by default and can be configured). On Windows this uses the Recycle Bin via `send2trash`. |
| `Empty trash` | Always | Permanently deletes all items from the trash. Shows a confirmation dialog before emptying. On Windows this uses PowerShell's `Clear-RecycleBin` to empty the Recycle Bin. |
| `Open in file manager` | Always | Opens the current directory in the OS file manager. Also available with `M`. |
| `Open terminal` | Always | Launches an external terminal rooted at zivo's current directory, using `config.toml` templates before built-in fallbacks. Also available with `T` and `t`. |
| `Run shell command` | Always | Opens a one-line shell command dialog, runs the command in the current directory in the background, and returns the first output line or failure summary in the status bar. On Windows, zivo prefers `powershell.exe`, then `pwsh`, then `cmd.exe`, so command syntax follows the selected Windows shell rather than POSIX `sh`. Also available with `!`. |
| `Bookmark this directory` / `Remove bookmark` | Always | Saves or removes the current directory in `[bookmarks].paths`. The label reflects whether the current directory is already bookmarked. Also available with `B`. |
| `Show hidden files` / `Hide hidden files` | Always | Toggles hidden-file visibility for the browser panes. The label reflects the current visibility state. Also available with `.`. |
| `Edit config` | Always | Opens the settings overlay for startup defaults. You can edit the preferred terminal editor, external terminal launch mode, hidden-file visibility, directory-size visibility, text preview visibility, image preview visibility, PDF preview visibility, Office preview visibility, preview size limit, theme, sorting, default paste-conflict behavior, and delete confirmation. The overlay also explains what the selected setting changes so you do not need to cross-reference the README while browsing options. Theme changes are previewed immediately. Use `↑` / `↓` or `Ctrl+n` / `Ctrl+p` to move, `←` / `→` / `Enter` to change values, `s` to save `config.toml`, and `e` to open the raw config file in a terminal editor. |
| `Create file` | Always | Starts the inline create-file flow in the current directory. |
| `Create directory` | Always | Starts the inline create-directory flow in the current directory. |

## Configuration File

On startup, zivo reads `config.toml` from the platform-specific user config directory.
If the file does not exist yet, zivo creates it automatically with default values.

- Linux: `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/zivo/config.toml`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/zivo/config.toml`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\\zivo\\config.toml`

The supported settings are:

| Section | Key | Values | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `terminal` | `linux` | Array of shell-style command templates | Optional terminal launch commands for Linux. Use `{path}` as the working-directory placeholder. Invalid or empty entries are ignored. |
| `terminal` | `macos` | Array of shell-style command templates | Optional terminal launch commands for macOS, validated the same way as Linux entries. |
| `terminal` | `windows` | Array of shell-style command templates | Optional terminal launch commands for Windows and WSL bridge workflows. |
| `editor` | `command` | Shell-style string, for example `nvim -u NONE` | Optional terminal editor command used by `e`. Do not include the file path; zivo appends it automatically. Unsupported GUI editors or invalid commands are ignored. |
| `display` | `show_hidden_files` | `true` / `false` | Default hidden-file visibility when the app starts. |
| `display` | `show_directory_sizes` | `true` / `false` | Shows recursive directory sizes in the current pane. Defaults to `true`. Large directories can be expensive to scan. zivo also calculates sizes automatically while the main pane is sorted by `size`. |
| `display` | `enable_text_preview` | `true` / `false` | Shows text-file previews in the right pane. Defaults to `true`. grep result context preview follows the same setting. |
| `display` | `enable_image_preview` | `true` / `false` | Shows image-file previews in the right pane through `chafa`. Defaults to `true`. When `chafa` is missing, zivo shows a dependency message instead of failing. |
| `display` | `enable_pdf_preview` | `true` / `false` | Enables PDF preview conversion through `pdftotext`. Defaults to `true`. When disabled, PDF files fall back to the usual unsupported-file message. |
| `display` | `enable_office_preview` | `true` / `false` | Enables `pandoc`-based preview conversion for `docx`, `xlsx`, and `pptx` files. Defaults to `true`. When disabled, those formats fall back to the usual unsupported-file message. |
| `display` | `show_help_bar` | `true` / `false` | Shows the help bar at the bottom of the screen. Defaults to `true`. The help bar is always shown when the command palette is open, regardless of this setting. |
| `display` | `theme` | Any built-in Textual theme, for example `textual-dark`, `textual-light`, `dracula`, or `tokyo-night` | Default UI theme applied on startup. In the settings editor, theme changes are previewed immediately and are persisted when you save. |
| `display` | `preview_syntax_theme` | `auto` or a supported Pygments style, for example `one-dark`, `xcode`, `nord`, or `gruvbox-dark` | Syntax-highlighting colors used by the right-pane text preview. `auto` keeps the current light/dark-based default selection. In the settings editor, changes are previewed immediately when a text preview is visible. |
| `display` | `preview_max_kib` | `64` / `128` / `256` / `512` / `1024` | Maximum amount of text read for right-pane file previews and preview sampling. Defaults to `64`. Larger values allow deeper previews at the cost of more I/O. |
| `display` | `default_sort_field` | `name` / `modified` / `size` | Default sort field for the main pane. |
| `display` | `default_sort_descending` | `true` / `false` | Starts the main-pane sort in descending order when enabled. |
| `display` | `directories_first` | `true` / `false` | Keeps directories grouped before files in the main pane. |
| `behavior` | `confirm_delete` | `true` / `false` | Shows a confirmation dialog before moving items to trash. Permanent delete via `D` / `Shift+Delete` always asks for confirmation. |
| `behavior` | `paste_conflict_action` | `prompt` / `overwrite` / `skip` / `rename` | Chooses the default paste-conflict behavior. `prompt` keeps the conflict dialog enabled. |
| `logging` | `enabled` | `true` / `false` | Enables file output for startup failures and unhandled exceptions. |
| `logging` | `level` | `DEBUG` / `INFO` / `WARNING` / `ERROR` / `CRITICAL` | Log level for file output. Defaults to `ERROR`. Requires app restart to take effect. |
| `logging` | `path` | Path string | Optional log file path. Leave empty to use `zivo.log` next to `config.toml`. Default log file locations: Linux: `~/.config/zivo/zivo.log`, macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/zivo/zivo.log`. |
| `bookmarks` | `paths` | Array of absolute path strings | Bookmarked directories shown by `b` and `Show bookmarks` in the command palette. Duplicate paths are removed when the config is loaded. |
| `file_search` | `max_results` | Integer or empty | Maximum number of file search results. Leave empty for unlimited (default). Set to reduce memory usage on large repositories. |

Invalid config values do not stop startup. zivo falls back to built-in defaults and shows a warning after the initial directory load.
When logging is enabled, startup failures and unhandled exceptions are appended to the configured log file for later investigation.
The accepted `display.theme` values come from the built-in themes shipped with the installed Textual version.
The accepted `display.preview_syntax_theme` values are `auto` plus the Pygments styles available in the installed environment.

## Notes

- Refer to the "Supported OS" section above for current support status.
- GUI integration such as default-app launch, file-manager launch, and external terminal launch is currently verified mainly on Ubuntu and Ubuntu running under WSL.
- `config.toml` can override both the preferred terminal editor and external terminal launch commands before built-in fallbacks are used.
- On WSL, `wslu` is recommended so `wslview` is available for the preferred bridge behavior.
- On WSL, zivo prefers Windows-side bridges such as `wslview`, `explorer.exe`, and `clip.exe` when available, while keeping Linux-side fallbacks for WSLg and desktop Linux environments.
- Behavior and keybindings may change in future revisions.
- File mutations operate on the selected directory entry. If the selected item is a symlink, zivo mutates the symlink itself instead of silently following and mutating the link target.
- Command palette symlink creation stores a relative target by default and supports `Tab` path completion in the destination input.
