zivo is a TUI file manager designed to be usable without memorizing dozens of shortcuts.

It keeps common actions visible in the help bar, and lets you run everything else from the command palette. You can browse, preview, search, grep, replace, and transfer files without leaving the terminal.

---

## Who zivo is for

- People who want a terminal file manager without memorizing many shortcuts
- People who want to browse, preview, search, grep, and replace files from the terminal
- People who find ranger, lf, nnn, or yazi powerful but somewhat expert-oriented
- People who work mainly in terminals or WSL and want to avoid switching to a GUI file manager

---

## Highlights

- **No memorization required**: common actions are always visible in the help bar
- **Command palette**: press `:` to search and run available actions
- **Three-pane preview**: preview directories, text, images, PDF, and Office files
- **Transfer mode**: copy and move files between two directories side by side
- **Search and grep**: find files, grep recursively, and open files from results
- **Replace with preview**: replace in grep results or files, review diffs before applying

---

Browse directories across three panes while previewing files on the right. Use file search and grep to quickly jump to any file. Common actions are always visible in the help bar, so you never feel lost.

Press `:` to search and run any action from the command palette. The palette supports incremental search, letting you find and execute commands quickly without memorizing keybindings.

Transfer mode puts two directories side by side for easy copy and move operations.
Press `y` to copy or `m` to move files to the opposite pane, and verify results immediately.

## Installation

### Minimal installation

```bash
uv tool install zivo
```

### Recommended tools

Some features use external commands.

| Feature | Tool |
| --- | --- |
| Image preview | `chafa` |
| PDF preview | `pdftotext` / `poppler` |
| Office preview | `pandoc` |
| Grep search | `ripgrep` |

See [Platforms](docs/platforms.md) for OS-specific setup instructions.

---

## Run

```bash
zivo
```

`zivo` itself cannot change the current directory of the parent shell. If you want your shell to follow the last directory you visited after quitting zivo, add shell integration first:

```bash
eval "$(zivo init bash)"  # for bash
eval "$(zivo init zsh)"   # for zsh
```

This defines a shell function named `zivo-cd`. Start zivo with `zivo-cd` when you want the parent shell to `cd` into the last directory on exit:

```bash
zivo-cd
```

**Note**: Shell integration (`zivo-cd`) is currently not supported on Windows. Use plain `zivo` on Windows.

---

## Basic controls

Common actions are always shown in the help bar.
You can also press `:` to open the command palette and search for available actions.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑` / `↓` or `j` / `k` | Move cursor |
| `Enter` | Open file / enter directory |
| `Backspace` / `←` | Go to parent directory |
| `Space` | Toggle selection |
| `:` | Open command palette |
| `/` | Filter entries |
| `f` | Find files |
| `g` | Grep search |
| `p` | Toggle Transfer mode |
| `q` | Quit |

See [Keybindings](docs/keybindings.md) for the full list.

---

## Command palette

Press `:` to search and run available actions.
This is useful for less frequently used operations or actions whose keybindings you do not remember.

See [Commands](docs/commands.md) for the full command list.

## Features

### Browsing
- **Three-pane layout**: directory tree on the left, file list in the center, preview on the right
- **Tabs**: open multiple directories and switch between them
- **Directory history**: go back / forward through visited directories
- **Bookmarks**: save directories and jump to them instantly
- **Go to path**: navigate to any path with Tab completion

### File operations
- **Copy / Cut / Paste**: within a pane or across panes in Transfer mode
- **Rename**: inline rename
- **Permissions**: change a single target's octal mode from the command palette
- **Delete**: move to trash (`d`) or permanent delete (`D`), with configurable confirmation
- **Undo**: revert rename, paste, or trash operations
- **Multi-selection**: select files with Space, or Select all

### Archives
- **Compress**: zip selected items
- **Extract**: extract zip / tar / tar.gz / tar.bz2

### Search and replace
- **Find files**: recursive filename search
- **Grep search**: recursive grep via ripgrep (filename / extension filters)
- **Replace**: batch replace in selected files, found files, or grep results with diff preview

### Preview
- Text, images (chafa; optional Kitty graphics protocol on compatible terminals), PDF (pdftotext), Office (pandoc)

### Transfer mode
- Side-by-side two-pane layout for copying or moving files between directories

### Command palette
- Press `:` to search and execute any action via incremental search. No need to memorize keybindings

### Customization
- **Settings overlay**: interactively edit and save startup configuration
- **Custom actions**: add external tools to the command palette
- **config.toml**: configure themes, sorting, preview visibility, delete confirmation, and more

### External integration
- **Editor**: open files in terminal or GUI editor
- **Terminal**: launch an external terminal in the current directory
- **Shell command**: run a command in the current directory
- **File manager**: open the current directory in the OS file manager
- **Clipboard**: copy paths to the system clipboard

---

## Configuration

zivo automatically creates `config.toml` on first launch.
You can configure themes, previews, sorting, editor integration, delete confirmation, and more.
You can also add custom command palette actions for external tools.

See [Configuration](docs/configuration.md) for details.
See [Custom Actions](docs/custom-actions.md) for custom action examples and safety notes.

---

## Safety

zivo includes safety mechanisms to prevent data loss during file operations.

- **Move to trash**: `d` / `Delete` moves items to the OS trash (confirmation dialog configurable)
- **Permanent delete**: `D` / `Shift+Delete` always asks for confirmation
- **Undo**: `z` reverses the last rename, paste, or trash operation
- **Paste conflict resolution**: choose overwrite, skip, or rename on name collision
- **Replace preview**: review diffs before applying batch replacements
- **More details**: see [Safety](docs/safety.md)
